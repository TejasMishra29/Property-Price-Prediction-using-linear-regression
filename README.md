# Property-Price-Prediction-using-linear-regression
n this project, the goal was to develop a machine learning model using linear regression to predict property prices based on various features. By analyzing a dataset containing information about different houses and their corresponding prices, we built a model that can accurately estimate property prices for unseen data.
